# Introduction
This script will pull the content from a user specified website and identify relevent materials, then it 
will download all these files to a directory namded "download". 

# Usage:
For demo, simply run
```
sh download.sh
```
in your terminal. It gets stuff from [UC Berkeley EE16A Fall 18 website](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/fa18/)
To download materials from websites of your own classes, please check the #TODO items in crawl.py to specify
a url, regex and probably update the selecting heuristic.
